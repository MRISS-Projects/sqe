OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=A tool for checking Java Code
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. \
    It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. \
    This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard.
